# eBayToReddit

A script to take all your eBay listings and turn them into a reddit for sale post. This is adapted to /r/CoinsForSale, but could be used for any situation where you have a bunch of inventory on eBay to list and don't want to go through the hassle of doing it all manually.

## Followup Work

* Pull all eBay images and make imgur post(s) to link to in reddit listing
